After my first two sessions of Mod 0 I'm very excited to get started and I've realized just how important it is to have my time organized. I haven't done much the last few months so I need to work a bit harder to get into a routine that I can stick with to be more successful.
I understand that I'm  not always going to get everything right away and that there are plenty of resources available for me to get help, starting with trial and error on my own, to google, to my cohort mates on slack and also all the instructors if all else fails!

One strategy I am committed to working with is trying to keep up with my calendar. I haven't really used one in the past, but I haven't had too many things to keep organized. So far google calendar seems pretty easy to keep organized and move things around.
Something I'm trying today while working on Mod 0 homework and project is putting my phone aside with a timer to stop playing my music after 45 min to tell me to take a break but now I'm also not distracted by my phone. We will see how it works.
